# MySQL8-Launcher

## Why use the launcher?
In MySQL8, **winmysqladmin.exe** is not really convenient to use because:
- :x: Outdated UI to make database changes.
- :x: Usually mistaken for virus.

But with MySQL8 Launcher, you will have:
- :heavy_check_mark: Clean and simple UI.
- :heavy_check_mark: Use for database startup only. Database changes can be done using third-party softwares like Navicat.

## How to use?
1. Extract the **MySQL8 Launcher.rar** to mysql8 folder.
2. Edit _my.ini_ file, change the path for `basedir` and `datadir` in mysql8 folder according to your current path mysql8 folder in your disk. _**(IMPORTANT)**_
3. Run **MySQL8 Launcher.exe** as administrator.
